## Problems:
```
// invalid opcode 0x47
// A new opcode, SELFBALANCE is introduced at 0x47

// https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1884.md

function totalSupply() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
}

// Fixed by:
Downgrade emv_verion from `Istanbul` to `Constantinople`
```
